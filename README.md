# To-Do List with React #
Project started as a playground and warmup for a technical interview (at the start).

## Description
The basic idea is to provide a home screen with a list of tasks with a completition status, Mobile-First.

### Why?
Have I not done a To-Do list before? yes, with react.js? yes I have, without it? we, *almost* all, have done it. But it's a good playground for a component structure testing.

## Pre-Requirements

### Testing
- `react-testing-library`
- `jest`

### Libraries
- `typescript`
- `react.js`
- `redux`
- `styled-components`

### CI/CD
- `Github Actions`

## How to use?

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
